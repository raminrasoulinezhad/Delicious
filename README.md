If you have any problem with cmake version: check this: "Installing Xilinx tools (Vivado/Vitis/...) change cmake installation location" as the following title

Also, don't forget to isntall these libraries before vtr installation:

    sudo apt install libtbb-dev
    sudo apt install libeigen3-dev
    sudo apt install libgtk-3-dev libx11-dev


### Installing Xilinx tools (Vivado/Vitis/...) change cmake installation location 

It cause problem with installing/upgrading/removing cmake. To solve this, you can give `/usr/local/bin` or `/usr/bin` priority by adding them to your path after vivado paths:

    export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH
    which cmake

To do it permanently:

    vim ~/.bashrc

and add this line at the end of the file:

    PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH
